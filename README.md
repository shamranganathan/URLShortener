# URLShortener  

I have implemented a # JavaScript function that takes a long URL as input and returns a shortened
version of the URL. Additionally, I have implement a function to decode the shortened
URL and redirect the user to the original long URL.

# 1. Shortening Function (encodeURL):
  a. Input: A long URL string.
  b. Output: A shortened URL string.
  c. The function should generate a unique short code for each long URL.
  d. The shortened URL should be of fixed length or customizable.
  e. The shortened URL should redirect to the original long URL when accessed.
  
# 2. Decoding and Redirect Function (decodeURL):
  a. Input: A shortened URL string.
  b. Output: Redirect the user to the original long URL.
  c. The function should decode the short code from the shortened URL and
      redirect the user to the original long URL.

  This application is implemented using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
